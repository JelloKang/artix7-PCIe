# artix7-PCIe
Originally designed for a SDR expansion card. Design includes breakout header, 2 general purpose buttons, and a SFP cage. 

Optimized for OSHPark 4 layer fab and home assembly. 

Design has been built but prototypes were killed by JTAG ground loop due to user error. Further work not certain, but please fork and feel free to contact for support.
